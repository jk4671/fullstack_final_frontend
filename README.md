# Notes Keeper (Frontend)

This is the frontend of the Notes Keeper app created using React. It lets users create, edit, and delete notes (with Title and Content).

It has been deployed on Vercel (https://fullstack-final-frontend-delta.vercel.app/).

This project was based off of Shivam Shekhar's Note Taking app (https://github.com/shvam0000/Full-Stack-Note-Taking-Application).

The backend can be found here: https://github.com/jk4671/fullstack_final_backend.git.
